# Holy Polley

## Holy Polley is a Web Polling App that involves the use of Node.js for the server and Firebase for data storage

This project is an exercise of Node.js and use of Firebase to host data. HTML/CSS/JS was used to create the user interface for the web polling app. 

I followed this tutorial from YouTuber Smoljames to create this application [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLUTHVf2mF4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLUTHVf2mF4)
